# An IDE for browser javascript, in your browser

I hate IDEs, I really do, but I think that's mainly because of language choice. IDEs go together well with GUIs and not so well with console based languages (looking at you Swing). JS was born in the browser (it didn't see a server until it was already a standard, you mearly adopted the web) so why do I have to generate the same jQuery code a million times to click, drag, delete, add things?

**ENOUGH!**
